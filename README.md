# Food-Delivery-Prediction
ETA prediction of food deliveries 
<br>
<br>
The food delivery time prediction model is essential in the food delivery industry, where timely and accurate deliveries are critical for customer satisfaction and overall experience.
<br>
<br>
I cleaned the dataset to eliminate errors and inconsistencies, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.
<br>
<br>
Next, feature engineering was used to derive valuable insights from the dataset. By considering factors such as the delivery person's age, ratings, location coordinates, and time-related variables, key elements that affect delivery time were identified.
<br>
<br>
We then built the predictive model using regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness. Model's accuracy was evaluated with metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

This food delivery time prediction model enables businesses to optimize their operations and enhance the overall delivery experience for their customers.
